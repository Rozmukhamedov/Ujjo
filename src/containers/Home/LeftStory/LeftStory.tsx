        HELLO, I’M LAUREN AND AS A LIFELONG <br /> ADVENTUROUS EATER, I’VE TRIED
        A LOT OF CRAZY <br /> THINGS, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT HOT SAUCE IN <br />
        COFFEE WAS A SANE OPTION UNTIL A FRIEND DARED <br /> ME TO TRY IT.
      </p>
      <p>AND IT SUCKED.</p>
      <p>
        BUT I WONDERED IF THERE WAS A WAY TO ADD <br /> SPICE TO MY COFFEE. WHEN
        THERE WAS NO <br /> EASY SOLUTION, UJJO WAS BORN.
      </p>
      <p>
        UJJO (OOO-JOE): THE WORD FOR “FIRE” IN <br /> KONKANI, SPOKEN ON THE
        WEST COAST OF <br /> INDIA, IS AN HOMAGE AND A LOVE LETTER TO MY <br />{" "}
        DAD, AN INDIAN IMMIGRANT WHO INSTILLED A <br /> FIRE IN MY PALATE – AND
        MY HEART – FROM <br /> THE VERY BEGINNING.
